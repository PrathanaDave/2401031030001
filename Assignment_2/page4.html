        <h1>Saturn</h1>
        <p>Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
        Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. 
        Saturn also has dozens of moons.</p>
        <p>From the jets of water that spray from <strong>Saturn's moon Enceladus</strong> to the methane 
        lakes on smoggy <strong>Titan</strong>, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery 
        and still holds many mysteries.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Namesake:</h2>
            <p>The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known 
            since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was 
            also the father of Jupiter.</p>

            <h2>Potential for Life:</h2>
            <p>Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, 
            and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for 
            organisms to adapt to. While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, 
            the same is not true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home 
            to internal oceans, could possibly support life.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Size and Distance:</h2>
            <p>With an equatorial diameter of about 14,891 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times 
            wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a 
            volleyball.</p>
            <p>From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 
            astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU) is the 
            distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel 
            from the Sun to Saturn.</p>
